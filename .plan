Features tests

- Submitting a new URL should return a shortened URL
- Hitting a shortened URL should end up in the original URL
- Stats should be collected and presented in the API endpoint

Controllers

url CRUD - in home page

/stats API endpoint

Data model

- urls
  - id
  - url
  - shortened_url
  - timestamp

- url_hits
  - id
  - url_id
  - remote_ip
  - headers

Let's see what we can get from headers first. If possible we want to get these:
  - browser
  - os
  - HTTP referer
  - timestamp

This is not a test if I will use https://github.com/jpmcgrath/shortener, right?
